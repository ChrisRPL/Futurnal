## 1. Executive Summary: The "Ghost" in the Machine

**Verdict: PASS (DO NOT INVEST in current state)**

**Futurnal** presents one of the most compelling *narratives* in the 2025 AI landscape: the evolution of a personal AI from a generic "Ghost" (LLM) into a highly personalized "Animal" (Causal Intelligence). However, our technical due diligence reveals a critical disconnect between this vision and the actual codebase.

The company is pitching a "Deep Tech" defensible moat (Causal Inference, Automated Self-Science) but has built a "Wrapper" product (Standard RAG). Until the core innovations at the "Analyst" and "Guide" layers are proven in code, the valuation is unsupported by technical reality.

## 2. The Vision: Ghost to Animal Evolution

The company's roadmap describes a sophisticated four-stage evolution of Personal AI, moving far beyond the "Chatbot" paradigm.

### Phase 1: The Archivist (Grounding the Ghost)
*   **Goal:** Perfect memory.
*   **Mechanism:** Ingesting local files, emails, and obsidian vaults into a Personal Knowledge Graph (PKG).
*   **Status:** **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED.** (Standard RAG architecture exists).

### Phase 2: The Analyst (Awakening Instincts)
*   **Goal:** Proactive insight.
*   **Mechanism:** "Emergent Insights" and "Curiosity Engine" that detect correlations in user behavior (e.g., "You are less productive on Fridays").
*   **Status:** **VAPORWARE.** (Empty classes with TODOs).

### Phase 3: The Guide (Animal Brain)
*   **Goal:** Causal understanding.
*   **Mechanism:** A Causal Inference Engine that explains *why* things happen, guided by an "Aspirational Self" reward function.
*   **Status:** **UNIMPLEMENTED.**

### Phase 4: Collective Intelligence (The "4th Futurnal")
*   **Goal:** Global evolution without privacy loss.
*   **Mechanism:** Federated Learning where individual "Animals" contribute learnings to the global model without sharing raw data.
*   **Status:** **CONCEPTUAL.**

## 3. Strategic Analysis: The "Prosumer" Moat

### The Opportunity
The "Productivity AI" market (Microsoft Copilot, Apple Intelligence) is crowded and focuses on **efficiency** ("Draft this email"). Futurnal correctly identifies a massive opening in the **introspective** market ("Why am I like this?").
*   **differentiation:** Moving from "What/How" to "Why".
*   **Lock-in:** A user who builds a "Causal Graph" of their life (sleep -> mood -> code quality) is incredibly sticky. They cannot switch to Apple Intelligence because Apple doesn't know their *causal structure*, only their data.

### The Risk
*   **The "Horoscope" Problem:** If the causal inference isn't mathematically rigorous, the product becomes a novelty toy that generates spurious correlations ("You write better code when it rains").
*   **The "Wrapper" Trap:** Without the proprietary causal engine, Futurnal is just a nice UI on top of Obsidian/Local LLMs. This is a fragile position against open-source plugins.

## 4. Technical Due Diligence Findings

We performed a code audit of the repository (`/Users/krzysztof/Futurnal`) focusing on the critical differentiators.

| Component | Claim | Reality | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ingestion** | "Perfect experiential memory" | **Solid.** Good connectors for Obsidian/Files. | ✅ Functional Foundation |
| **Privacy** | "Local-first sovereignty" | **Excellent.** Strong consent/redaction models. | ✅ Trustworthy Architecture |
| **Causal Engine** | "World model of user's life" | **MISSING.** `TemporalCorrelationDetector` is a shell. | 🔴 **CRITICAL FAILURE** |
| **Curiosity** | "Proactive gap detection" | **MISSING.** `CuriosityEngine` lacks logic. | 🔴 **CRITICAL FAILURE** |

**Conclusion:** The team has spent 12 months building the *plumbing* (Privacy, RAG) but has effectively ignored the *core innovation* (Causal Logic). The `VISION_ALIGNMENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` from Jan 2025 flagged this exact issue, and it remains unaddressed in Dec 2025.

## 5. Final Verdict & Recommendation

**We cannot recommend investment at this stage.**

The gap between the "Sci-Fi" pitch and the "Wrapper" reality is too wide. The founders are selling a vision of Causal AI but delivering a File Indexer.

**Conditions for Re-evaluation:**
1.  **Prototype the "Animal":** We need to see *one* working example of the `TemporalCorrelationDetector` finding a real, non-obvious insight from user data.
2.  **Mobile Strategy:** "Experiential learning" requires capturing life on the go. A desktop-only tool misses 50% of the signal.

**Closing Thought:** Futurnal is a "Vitamin" trying to become a "Painkiller." If they solve the Causal Inference challenge, they build a unicorn. Until then, they are building a better spotlight search.

**Decision: PASS**
