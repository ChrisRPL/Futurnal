Summary: Explains why Futurnal extends beyond standard GraphRAG via its causal inference layer and guided self-reflection.

# Key Technical Differentiator

## Beyond GraphRAG
While Futurnal relies on Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) to structure personal data, the project's innovation lies in transforming retrieval capabilities into causal exploration. GraphRAG alone can answer "what" questions; Futurnal introduces a "why" engine that supports introspection without relying on speculative LLM reasoning.

## Proactive Correlation Detection
- The agentic layer continuously analyzes timestamped PKG data to surface significant, non-obvious correlations (e.g., sleep quality vs. productivity trends).
- Insights are packaged with statistical context and confidence signals to ground further investigation.

## LLM as Interface, Not Oracle
- Futurnal prompts local LLMs with causal inference principles to generate candidate hypotheses, positioning them as exploratory paths rather than truths.
- The system maintains guardrails to avoid hallucinated causality by distinguishing between correlation and causation explicitly in responses.

## Guided Causal Exploration
- Users interrogate hypotheses through conversational workflows that trigger targeted PKG queries.
- The system checks for confounders, compares temporal patterns, and presents evidentiary summaries to help users decide on plausible explanations.

## Introspective Outcomes
- Futurnal acts as a reflective partner, helping users align daily actions with aspirational goals.
- By combining structured data analysis with AI-guided dialogue, Futurnal provides depth unavailable in typical personal knowledge management or journaling tools.
