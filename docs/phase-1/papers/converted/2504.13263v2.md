Abstract
Causal analysis plays a foundational role in scientific discovery and reliable decision-
making, yet it remains largely inaccessible to domain experts due to its conceptual and
algorithmic complexity. This disconnect between causal methodology and practical us-
ability presents a dual challenge: domain experts are unable to leverage recent advances
in causal learning, while causal researchers lack broad, real-world deployment to test and
refine their methods. To address this, we introduce Causal-Copilot, an autonomous agent
that operationalizes expert-level causal analysis within a large language model framework.
Causal-Copilot automates the full pipeline of causal analysis for both tabular and time-
series data—including causal discovery, causal inference, algorithm selection, hyperparam-
eter optimization, result interpretation, and generation of actionable insights. It supports
interactive refinement through natural language, lowering the barrier for non-specialists
while preserving methodological rigor. By integrating over 20 state-of-the-art causal anal-
ysis techniques, our system fosters a virtuous cycle - expanding access to advanced causal
methods for domain experts while generating rich, real-world applications that inform and
advance causal theory. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Causal-Copilot achieves
superior performance compared to existing baselines, offering a reliable, scalable, and ex-
tensible solution that bridges the gap between theoretical sophistication and real-world
applicability in causal analysis.

1 Introduction
Causal learning and reasoning lie at the foundation of scientific understanding and principled
decision-making. They enable researchers to move beyond associational patterns to uncover
the underlying mechanisms that govern observed phenomena (Spirtes et al., 2000). By
revealing how system variables interact and influence outcomes, causal analysis provides
a foundation for actionable insights across critical domains, including healthcare (Prosperi
et al., 2020), economics (Imbens, 2020), and engineering (Kleinberg and Hripcsak, 2011).
As data-driven systems increasingly underpin high-stakes applications, integrating causal
reasoning into analytical pipelines has become essential for building models that are not
only accurate but also robust, interpretable, and trustworthy.
Over the past decades, the field has seen a rapid development of methods for causal
discovery, treatment effect estimation, and counterfactual inference (Nogueira et al., 2022).
These methods are grounded in diverse theoretical frameworks and designed to accom-
modate real-world challenges such as latent confounding, selection bias, nonstationarity, or
feedback loops. However, despite their growing sophistication, these methods remain largely
underutilized in practice due to their steep learning curves, algorithmic diversity, and the
expert knowledge required to navigate them effectively (Machlanski, 2024). This creates
a paradoxical situation where increasingly powerful causal tools are developed but rarely
deployed at scale—domain experts cannot access the methodological advances they need,
while causal researchers lack the broad real-world testing grounds necessary to refine their
approaches, perpetuating the disconnect between theoretical sophistication and practical
applicability.
A complete causal analysis pipeline typically involves multiple interconnected steps:
understanding the task, selecting appropriate algorithms based on data characteristics and
assumptions, configuring hyperparameters, executing causal discovery or inference proce-
dures, and interpreting results (Machlanski, 2024). Each step demands familiarity with the
underlying assumptions, limitations of various approaches, and domain-specific constraints.
In practice, such expertise is rarely available across application domains, and organizations
are often forced to rely on oversimplified heuristics or manual trial-and-error processes. This
limits the scalability and reliability of causal analysis in applied settings and highlights the
need for more intelligent and accessible tools.
To address these challenges, we proposeCausal-Copilot, a modular system powered by
large language models (LLMs) that automates the entire causal analysis workflow. The sys-
tem integrates components for task understanding, algorithm selection, data preprocessing,
inference execution, and result interpretation, all coordinated through a centralized reason-
ing layer (Brown et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2023). Given a tabular or time-series dataset
and a natural language query, Causal-Copilot identifies the analytical intent, configures
appropriate methods and hyperparameters, and executes the analysis. It then generates
a structured PDF report containing visualizations of descriptive statistics, inferred causal
structures, treatment effects, and accompanying natural language explanations. The inter-
face supports optional user interaction, allowing users to monitor and refine the process
without programming expertise.
Causal-Copilot currently integrates over 20 state-of-the-art causal learning methods, in-
cluding constraint-based, score-based, and hybrid approaches for structure learning, as well

as inference algorithms based on double machine learning and counterfactual estimation.
This design allows for multi-perspective analysis and robustness checks without requiring
users to manually implement or configure individual tools. Empirical results demonstrate
that Causal-Copilot outperforms standard baselines across multiple tasks and datasets, val-
idating the effectiveness of its automated algorithm selection and parameter-tuning strate-
gies. More broadly, this work contributes to the development of intelligent, interpretable,
and extensible systems for causal learning and reasoning - bringing advanced causal analy-
sis within reach of a wider community of researchers and practitioners, and facilitating its
integration into practical workflows across disciplines.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the overall architecture of Causal-
Copilot, highlighting its modular design. Section 3 details the supported causal discovery
and inference algorithms, along with additional analytical tools. Section 4 describes the
workflow and usage of Causal-Copilot in practical scenarios. Section 5 reports extensive
experimental results across diverse datasets, providing comprehensive evaluations and com-
parisons under various settings.
2 Architecture
This section provides an overview of the architecture of Causal-Copilot, which is designed as
a modular framework comprising five core components: Simulation, User Interaction, Pre-
processing, Algorithm Selection, Postprocessing. These modules form a cohesive workflow
for end-to-end causal analysis. At the center of the system, an LLM orchestrates the overall
workflow by directing information flow between modules and leveraging external resources,
such as a causality-specific knowledge memory and local algorithm libraries. Communica-
tion between modules is facilitated through standardized interfaces that transmit structured
metadata and intermediate outputs. This design enables the LLM to manage the execution
