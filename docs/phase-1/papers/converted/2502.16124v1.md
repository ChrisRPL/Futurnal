ABSTRACT
Zero-Input AI (ZIA) introduces a novel framework for human-computer interaction by enabling
proactive intent prediction without explicit user commands. It integrates gaze tracking, bio-signals
(EEG, heart rate), and contextual data (time, location, usage history) into a multi-modal model for
real-time inference, targeting <100 ms latency. The proposed architecture employs a transformer-
based model with cross-modal attention, variational Bayesian inference for uncertainty estimation,
and reinforcement learning for adaptive optimization. To support deployment on edge devices (CPUs,
TPUs, NPUs), ZIA utilizes quantization, weight pruning, and linear attention to reduce complexity
from quadratic to linear with sequence length. Theoretical analysis establishes an information-
theoretic bound on prediction error and demonstrates how multi-modal fusion improves accuracy over
single-modal approaches. Expected performance suggests 85-90% accuracy with EEG integration and
60-100 ms inference latency. ZIA provides a scalable, privacy-preserving framework for accessibility,
healthcare, and consumer applications, advancing AI toward anticipatory intelligence.

1 Introduction
Human-computer interaction (HCI) has evolved from manual punch cards to graphical interfaces and, more recently,
natural language-based AI systems. Despite these advances, modern AI remains fundamentally reactive, requiring
explicit user commands to perform tasks. This reliance introduces latency, cognitive effort, and accessibility barriers,
particularly for individuals unable to engage through conventional input methods. The inefficiency of this paradigm
is evident in daily interactions, where users must repeatedly issue commands, and in critical domains like healthcare,
where delays in execution can impact real-time responsiveness.
Zero-Input AI (ZIA) seeks to dismantle this dependency by shifting the interaction paradigm from reactive to proactive,
inferring user intent directly from passive multi-modal signals without requiring explicit commands. These signals
include gaze tracking, capturing spatial focus via eye movements; bio-signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG)
and heart rate, reflecting cognitive and physiological states; and contextual data, such as time, location, and historical
usage patterns, providing situational awareness. Formally, ZIA addresses the problem of predicting a latent intent
variable It ∈ Iat time t from a time-series history of signals
S1:t = {S1, S2, . . . , St}
where each observation
St = {sg(t), sb(t), sc(t)}
encapsulates the multi-modal input space.

The objective is to identify the most probable intent, framed as a probabilistic inference task:
I∗
t = arg max
I∈I
P(I|S1:t)
while ensuring execution occurs within strict real-time constraints, targeting an inference latency below 100 milliseconds.
The motivation for ZIA stems from both practical and theoretical imperatives. Practically, eliminating explicit input
reduces friction in human-computer workflows, enabling seamless integration of AI into daily life. For users with motor
or speech impairments, ZIA offers a pathway to interact with technology through natural, passive cues, enhancing
accessibility. In healthcare, proactive intent prediction could enable systems to anticipate patient needs—such as
adjusting medical equipment based on bio-signal shifts—without manual intervention, potentially improving outcomes
in time-sensitive scenarios. Theoretically, ZIA challenges the conventional input-output model of AI by demanding
advances in multi-modal signal processing, real-time adaptation, and edge computing, pushing the boundaries of
machine learning beyond static, command-driven frameworks.
To achieve this vision, ZIA integrates several key innovations:
• A multi-modal fusion pipeline leveraging a transformer-based architecture with cross-modal attention mecha-
nisms to synthesize heterogeneous signals into a coherent intent representation, capturing interdependencies
across gaze, bio-signals, and context.
• A variational Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainty in intent predictions, addressing the inherent noise
and variability in physiological data.
• Reinforcement learning with policy optimization, enabling continuous adaptation to refine user intent under-
standing over time based on implicit feedback.
• Edge optimization techniques, including model quantization, weight pruning, and linear attention approx-
imations, ensuring ZIA operates efficiently on resource-constrained devices while preserving privacy by
minimizing cloud dependency and meeting real-time latency requirements.
This paper presents ZIA as a purely theoretical framework, establishing a comprehensive mathematical and algorithmic
foundation for proactive intent prediction. Our contributions include:
• A multi-modal fusion model that integrates gaze, bio-signals, and contextual data using contrastive learning
and transformer-based attention, designed to maximize signal complementarity.
• A variational Bayesian formulation for intent inference, providing a probabilistic framework to handle
uncertainty in noisy, multi-modal inputs.
• A reinforcement learning mechanism with theoretical convergence properties, enabling adaptive intent predic-
tion tailored to individual users.
• An edge-optimized inference strategy with detailed computational trade-offs, targeting low-latency execution
across diverse hardware platforms.
• Theoretical analyses, including an information-theoretic error bound and mutual information framework,
demonstrating the advantages of multi-modal integration over single-modal baselines.
The scope of this work is deliberately theoretical, laying a rigorous groundwork for ZIA without empirical validation
at this stage. We anticipate that future experimental efforts will refine the projected performance metrics—such as
intent accuracy of 85-90% with EEG integration and latency of 60-100 milliseconds—derived herein from signal
entropy and computational complexity considerations. ZIA’s potential applications span accessibility (e.g., enabling
motor-impaired users to control devices via passive cues), healthcare (e.g., real-time monitoring and intervention), and
consumer technology (e.g., frictionless interfaces for smartphones and wearables). By redefining AI as an anticipatory,
rather than reactive, system, ZIA offers a scalable, privacy-preserving blueprint for the next generation of intelligent
interaction, inviting subsequent research to build upon this foundation.
2 Related Work
Zero-Input AI (ZIA) sits at the intersection of multi-modal machine learning, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs),
reinforcement learning (RL), and edge computing, drawing on and extending a rich body of prior research. This section
surveys these fields, highlighting their contributions and limitations relative to ZIA’s goal of proactive, input-free intent
prediction with real-time, edge-optimized execution.
2ZIA: A Theoretical Framework for Zero-Input AI
2.1 Multi-Modal Machine Learning
Multi-modal learning has gained prominence for integrating heterogeneous data sources into unified representations, a
cornerstone of ZIA’s signal fusion pipeline. CLIP [1] pioneered contrastive learning to align text and image embeddings,
achieving robust zero-shot classification by maximizing mutual information between modalities. Similarly, ImageBind
[2] extends this paradigm to six modalities (text, images, audio, depth, thermal, IMU), using a shared embedding space
to enable cross-modal retrieval. These models excel in static, task-specific settings but lack temporal reasoning critical
for intent prediction over time-series signals like gaze or EEG.
Earlier efforts, such as the Multi-Modal Transformer [3], introduced cross-modal attention to fuse audio and visual
inputs for emotion recognition, demonstrating improved performance over uni-modal baselines. However, these
approaches assume pre-aligned inputs and predefined tasks, whereas ZIA targets dynamic, unprompted intent inference
from unaligned physiological and contextual cues.
Other frameworks, like Data2Vec [4], leverage self-supervised learning across text, speech, and images, predicting
latent representations to unify modalities. While versatile, they prioritize generalization over real-time constraints, with
inference latencies often exceeding hundreds of milliseconds—far beyond ZIA’s 100 ms target. The lack of proactive
intent modeling in these works underscores a key gap: multi-modal AI remains reactive, awaiting user-defined queries
rather than anticipating needs from passive signals.
2.2 Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)
BCIs provide a direct precedent for intent prediction from bio-signals, particularly EEG, a core modality in ZIA.
Seminal work by [5] established EEG-based control for cursor movement, achieving binary intent classification (e.g.,
left vs. right) with accuracies of 80-90% in controlled settings. More recent advances, such as DeepConvNet [6], apply
convolutional neural networks to raw EEG, improving motor imagery classification to ∼85% across four classes. These
systems rely on explicit user training and predefined task sets, contrasting with ZIA’s goal of unsupervised, free-form
intent detection.
Non-invasive BCIs have also explored event-related potentials (ERPs) for intent, with [7] decoding P300 signals for
spelling tasks at ∼80% accuracy. However, ERP-based methods require stimulus-driven paradigms (e.g., visual cues),
limiting their applicability to zero-input contexts where no external trigger exists. Invasive approaches, like Neuralink’s
primate studies [8], achieve higher precision via implanted electrodes, but their impracticality for consumer use drives
ZIA toward scalable, non-invasive solutions. BCI research excels at signal-specific intent but lacks multi-modal
integration and edge deployment, key differentiators for ZIA.
2.3 Reinforcement Learning (RL)
RL offers a foundation for ZIA’s adaptive intent prediction. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [10] provides a stable,
sample-efficient policy gradient method, widely adopted in robotics and gaming (e.g., OpenAI’s Dota 2 agent), balancing
exploration and exploitation via clipped objectives. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) [?] extends RL to
continuous action spaces, applied in autonomous driving [11]. These methods optimize policies against well-defined
rewards, but ZIA adapts them to sparse, implicit feedback (e.g., intent overrides), a less-explored domain.
Human-in-the-loop RL, as in [9], incorporates user preferences to refine policies, achieving robust alignment in text
generation tasks. Yet, these approaches assume active user input, unlike ZIA’s passive signal reliance. Adaptive BCIs
[12] use RL to tune EEG classifiers but focus on single modalities without ZIA’s multi-modal complexity. RL’s strength
in dynamic adaptation is tempered by its computational overhead, motivating ZIA’s edge optimization focus.
2.4 Edge AI and Real-Time Systems
Edge computing is critical for ZIA’s low-latency, privacy-preserving goals. [13] survey edge AI, reporting inference
times of 50–100 ms for vision models on mobile GPUs, leveraging quantization and pruning. MobileNet [14] optimizes
convolutional networks for edge devices, achieving∼70% accuracy on ImageNet with∼100 ms latency on smartphones.
More recently, EfficientNet [15] scales model depth efficiently, but its complexity exceeds ZIA’s real-time needs without
further compression.
Real-time systems like YOLOv4 [ 16] push object detection to 30-50 ms on edge hardware, using techniques like
FP16 quantization—paralleling ZIA’s approach. However, these models process single-modal inputs (e.g., images),
not ZIA’s multi-modal streams. Edge-optimized transformers, such as Linformer [ 17] and Performer [ 18], reduce
attention complexity to O(N), aligning with ZIA’s linear attention strategy, though they target language or vision, not
physiological signals. Edge AI excels in latency but lacks intent-driven, multi-modal frameworks.
