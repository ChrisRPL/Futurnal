# Phase 1 Docs (Pruned)

This folder was heavily pruned for open-source handoff.

What remains:

- only the subset of Phase 1 production-plan docs directly referenced by code/tests
- no bundled paper corpus
- no internal planning or completion-report artifacts

If you need deeper historical docs, recover them from Git history.
