## CRITICAL INSIGHTS FROM PAPER ANALYSIS

### Insight 1: "Early Experience" is THE Paradigm for Ghost→Animal

**From Paper 2510.08558v1:**
> "how can we train agents to grow from their own experience, without any external reward signals?"

**Current Spec Problem:**
```python
# Current Spec (2020-era)
def process_document(doc):
    triples = llm_extract(doc)
    log_feedback(triples)  # Passive
    return triples

# What Papers Show (2025-era)
def process_document_with_early_experience(doc):
    # Propose action
    triples = ghost_extract(doc)

    # Observe future state
    kg_state = update_pkg(triples)

    # Use future state as supervision
    quality = world_state_model.assess(kg_state)

    # Learn from experience
    ghost.learn_from_experience(quality)

    return triples
```

**Key Difference:**
- Current: Passive logging for "future tuning"
- Papers: Active learning from immediate outcomes
- Current: External supervision needed
- Papers: Future states ARE supervision

---

### Insight 2: Temporal Extraction is NON-NEGOTIABLE

**From Paper 2505.13508v2:**
> "temporal intelligence... struggling to integrate reasoning about the past with predictions"

**Current Spec:** ZERO mention of temporal extraction
**Paper Evidence:** 51 temporal mentions in Time-R1 alone

**Why Fatal:**
```
Phase 3 Goal: Causal Inference
Requirement: Temporal relationships
Current Spec: No temporal extraction
Result: Phase 3 IMPOSSIBLE
```

**Solution from Papers:**
- Time-R1: RL curriculum for temporal understanding
- Extract: before(), after(), during(), causes()
- Foundation: Temporal KG for causal discovery

---

### Insight 3: Schema Must Evolve (Not Static Templates)

**From Paper 2501.02157v2:**
> "user-centric knowledge graphs... context-rich generation even in sparse or cold-start settings"

**Current Spec:**
> "Prompt templates tuned for entity/relationship identification by document type"

**Problem:** Static templates cannot evolve with Ghost→Animal

**Solution from Papers:**
- Implicit world modeling (predict schema evolution)
- Self-reflection (refine based on patterns)
- Autonomous induction (not predefined)

---

### Insight 4: Privacy + Personalization are Compatible

**From Paper 2501.13904v3 (ICLR 2025):**
> "low-rank factorization... with differential privacy... balances personalization, generalization, and privacy"

**Current Spec Limitation:**
- Mentions on-device but no personalization strategy
- No network effects
- No federated learning path

**Solution from Papers:**
- Local DP for personal data
- Federated learning for global improvement
- Both without compromise

---
