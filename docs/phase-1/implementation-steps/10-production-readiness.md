## Research Foundation

### Federated Prompt Learning (2501.13904v3)
Prepare infrastructure for future federated learning:
- Privacy-preserving design verified
- Local-first architecture maintained
- Future federation hooks in place

## Final Validation

### User Journey Test
Walk through complete user journey:
1. Install application
2. Sign up / log in
3. Add data sources
4. Wait for ingestion
5. Search knowledge
6. Chat with data
7. Explore graph
8. View temporal events
9. Manage privacy settings

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] First search < 1s
- [ ] Graph render < 500ms
- [ ] Chat response < 3s
- [ ] Ingestion > 5 docs/sec

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All quality gates GREEN
- [ ] User journey smooth
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Files to Update

- `README.md` - Installation instructions
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `docs/user-guide.md` - User documentation
- `docs/api-reference.md` - API docs

## Phase 1 Complete Deliverables

1. **Intelligent Search** - Semantic + GraphRAG
2. **LLM Answers** - Synthesized responses
3. **Chat Interface** - Conversational AI
4. **Temporal Extraction** - Time-aware PKG
5. **Schema Evolution** - Autonomous learning
6. **Experiential Learning** - Ghost improvement
7. **Causal Preparation** - Phase 3 foundation
8. **Frontend Integration** - Full user experience

10. **Production Ready** - Ship it!

## PHASE 1 COMPLETE

After this step, Phase 1 (Archivist) is complete and revolutionary.

The Ghost has:
- Perfect memory of user's digital experience
- Semantic understanding via GraphRAG
- Temporal awareness for causal foundation
- Autonomous schema evolution
- Experiential learning capability
- Production-ready user experience

**Ready for Phase 2 (Analyst): Proactive insights and pattern recognition.**
