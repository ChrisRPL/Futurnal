# Research Notes

This folder keeps concise research alignment notes used to explain major architecture decisions.

- `memory-architecture.md`: hierarchical memory design (working / episodic / semantic)
- `self-evolution-approach.md`: context-evolution approach and Option B constraints

## Why no bundled papers?

The repository no longer stores bulk paper PDFs or converted dumps.

Reasons:

- keeps clone size small
- avoids redistributing large third-party files
- keeps maintenance focused on implementation and citations

Use arXiv IDs in docs for source lookup.
