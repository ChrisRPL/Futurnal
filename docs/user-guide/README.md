# Futurnal User Guide

Privacy-first personal knowledge engine for understanding your digital life.

## What is Futurnal?

Futurnal transforms your scattered digital knowledge into a connected, searchable intelligence engine. Unlike simple search tools, Futurnal understands relationships between your data, tracks temporal patterns, and helps you discover the "why" behind your thoughts.

**Core Philosophy**: Move from "What did I know?" to "Why do I think this?"
