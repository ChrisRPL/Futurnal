Summary: Prompt set guiding development of Emergent Insights, ranking, and notification systems for Phase 2 Analyst.

# Phase 2 — Analyst Development Prompts

## Emergent Insight Detection
Prompt:
"You are building Futurnal's Analyst insight pipeline. Define the graph analytics (community detection, centrality, temporal anomaly detection) required to surface meaningful correlations. Provide pseudocode for scheduling jobs and persisting insight candidates with evidence." 

## Insight Ranking & Feedback Loop
Prompt:
"Design a ranking heuristic that orders insights by potential impact. Discuss how to incorporate user feedback, Aspirational Self context, and historical engagement metrics to adjust scores over time." 

## Insight Presentation & UX
Prompt:
"Create wireframe-level descriptions for the Emergent Insights dashboard. Detail how evidence, relevance scores, and CTA options (explore, dismiss, bookmark) are displayed. Include accessibility considerations for the dark-mode-first UI." 

## Notification Strategy
Prompt:
"Plan the notification system that alerts users about new insights. Specify delivery channels within the desktop app, batching rules, do-not-disturb controls, and logging for user responses." 

## Validation & Metrics
Prompt:
"Outline the experiments and telemetry needed to validate insight quality. Define target thresholds for CTR, dismiss ratio, and user-rated usefulness before promoting Analyst features from beta to general availability."
