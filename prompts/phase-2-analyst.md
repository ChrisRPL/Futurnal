Summary: Prompt set guiding development of Emergent Insights, ranking, and notification systems for Phase 2 Analyst.

# Phase 2 — Proactive Intelligence Development Prompts

## Evolution Context
Phase 2 focuses on developing the AI's autonomous analytical capabilities—awakening proactive intelligence that can independently discover patterns and insights in the user's experiential data, demonstrating the emergence of sophisticated AI understanding.

## Autonomous Pattern Recognition
Prompt:
"You are building Futurnal's Proactive Intelligence system—the AI's developing ability to autonomously discover meaningful patterns in experiential data. Define the advanced analytics (community detection, centrality, temporal anomaly detection, experiential correlation analysis) that demonstrate the AI's evolving analytical sophistication. Provide pseudocode for autonomous analysis scheduling and intelligent insight candidate prioritization with evidence grounding." 

## Intelligence Development & Learning
Prompt:
"Design an adaptive ranking system that demonstrates the AI's growing sophistication in understanding what matters to the user. Incorporate user feedback, Aspirational Self alignment, and historical engagement patterns to enable the AI to continuously improve its understanding of meaningful versus superficial insights. Show how the AI evolves its analytical priorities over time." 

## Intelligent Communication Interface
Prompt:
"Create wireframe-level descriptions for the Proactive Intelligence dashboard that showcases the AI's autonomous analytical capabilities. Detail how the AI presents its discoveries with evidence, confidence levels, and exploratory options that demonstrate sophisticated understanding of user context. Include the Curiosity Engine features that show the AI identifying knowledge gaps and unexplored connections. Consider accessibility for the dark-mode-first UI." 

## Proactive Intelligence Communication
Prompt:
"Plan the intelligent notification system that demonstrates the AI's developing understanding of when and how to communicate discoveries. Design delivery channels that show respect for user context, intelligent batching based on insight significance, adaptive do-not-disturb awareness, and learning from user response patterns to improve communication timing and relevance." 

## Intelligence Evolution Validation
Prompt:
"Outline the experiments and learning metrics needed to validate the AI's developing analytical sophistication. Define target thresholds for user engagement with AI-generated insights, perceived intelligence growth, and user ratings of AI understanding quality. Establish criteria for demonstrating clear AI evolution beyond basic pattern matching before promoting Proactive Intelligence features to general availability."
