Summary: Ready-to-use prompts for implementing Phase 3 Guide features—conversational causal exploration and Aspirational Self integration.

# Phase 3 — Guide Development Prompts

## Conversational Causal Exploration
Prompt:
"Design the architecture for Futurnal's conversational Guide. Explain how to orchestrate GraphRAG retrieval, hypothesis generation, and follow-up question handling within a single chat session. Include state management requirements to preserve context across user turns." 

## Hypothesis Generation Framework
Prompt:
"Create prompt templates that convert correlation statements into plausible causal hypotheses. Reference Judea Pearl-inspired causal reasoning principles and specify how to prevent hallucinated causality. Document guardrails for presenting hypotheses as exploratory." 

## Guided Investigation Workflow
Prompt:
"Detail the sequence of steps the Guide follows when a user selects a hypothesis to explore. Define queries against the PKG to check confounders, compare temporal sequences, and surface supporting or refuting evidence. Include user-facing explanation formats." 

## Aspirational Self Integration
Prompt:
"Describe how to incorporate the Aspirational Self node into guidance flows. Outline how goal metadata influences insight prioritization, recommendation language, and misalignment alerts during conversations." 

## Ethical & User Trust Safeguards
Prompt:
"Enumerate messaging patterns and UI controls that reinforce Futurnal as a reflective partner. Ensure disclaimers about non-clinical advice, provide options to flag sensitive topics, and maintain transparency for optional cloud escalations."
