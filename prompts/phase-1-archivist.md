Summary: Prompt script to develop and validate Phase 1 Archivist capabilities—data ingestion, PKG construction, and hybrid search UI.

# Phase 1 — Personalized Foundation Development Prompts

## Evolution Context
Phase 1 focuses on establishing the AI's experiential memory foundation—grounding generic AI capabilities in the user's personal universe to enable the beginning of true AI personalization and evolution.

## Experiential Memory Architecture
Prompt:
"You are implementing Futurnal's Phase 1 Personalized Foundation—the system that grounds generic AI in personal experiential data. Design the experiential memory pipeline that connects to local directories, Obsidian vaults, IMAP email, and GitHub repositories. The AI must learn to understand the user's personal data universe with <1% parsing failure. Specify libraries, data flow diagrams, and error handling strategies that enable reliable AI learning from experiential sources."

## AI Learning Pipeline
Prompt:
"Design the experiential learning system for a local 8B quantized model that learns to understand user patterns by converting experiential data into meaningful semantic relationships (Subject, Predicate, Object). The AI should develop increasingly sophisticated understanding of the user's personal universe. Include confidence scoring, experiential provenance tracking, and incremental learning capabilities when experiential sources change."

## Experiential Memory Construction
Prompt:
"Describe how to construct, evolve, and query the AI's experiential memory system using embedded Neo4j. This serves as the foundation for AI personalization—the living memory that enables understanding of the user's personal universe. Provide Cypher examples for building experiential relationships, retrieving personalized context, and evolving the memory structure as the AI learns." 

## Personalized Intelligence Interface
Prompt:
"Create the UX flow for Futurnal's personalized search interface that demonstrates the AI's developing understanding of the user's experiential patterns. Detail how the AI combines semantic understanding with experiential memory to provide responses that show genuine familiarity with the user's personal context. Include adaptive behaviors that evolve as the AI's understanding becomes more sophisticated."

## Evolution Foundation Validation
Prompt:
"List the AI development benchmarks, learning quality metrics, and privacy safeguards required before shipping Phase 1. Include methods to verify that the AI demonstrates genuine personalized understanding, maintains sub-second response times, and ensures experiential data never leaves the device without explicit user consent for AI enhancement."
