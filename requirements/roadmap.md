Summary: Provides the phased MVP rollout plan, success metrics, and milestone checkpoints for Futurnal.

# AI Evolution Roadmap

## Overview
Futurnal progresses through three evolutionary phases that transform generic AI into sophisticated personalized intelligence. Each phase builds the AI's capabilities toward genuine experiential understanding. Timelines reflect the initial 15-month evolution plan and should be revisited quarterly as the AI's sophistication develops.

## Phase 1 · Personalized Foundation (Months 1–4)
- **Evolution Goals:** Establish the AI's experiential memory foundation, enabling personalized understanding of the user's data universe.
- **Foundational Capabilities:**
  - Experiential connectors for local files, Obsidian vaults, IMAP email, GitHub repositories—building the AI's personal memory.
  - Automated experiential learning through entity extraction and PKG construction.
  - Personalized search interface demonstrating superior understanding of user context.
  - Interactive memory visualization showing how the AI perceives the user's knowledge network.
- **Evolution Milestones:**
  - Stable experiential learning from three data sources with <1% parsing failures.
  - Query intelligence under 1 second demonstrating personalized understanding.
  - Beta users experiencing clearly superior personalized search capabilities.
- **Evolution KPIs:** User engagement with personalized search, AI's demonstrated understanding accuracy, experiential data source integration depth.

## Phase 2 · Proactive Intelligence (Months 5–9)
- **Evolution Goals:** Develop the AI's autonomous analytical capabilities and proactive pattern recognition in experiential data.
- **Intelligent Capabilities:**
  - Emergent Insights engine demonstrating autonomous analysis of personal patterns.
  - Curiosity Engine that identifies knowledge gaps and unexplored connections in experiential data.
  - Intelligent ranking system aligned with user feedback and Aspirational Self goals.
  - Proactive notification system demonstrating the AI's developing analytical instincts.
- **Evolution Milestones:**
  - Autonomous insight generation running daily with ≥90% uptime, showing AI's developing intelligence.
  - Intelligent ranking achieving >50% user "valuable" ratings, demonstrating personalized understanding.
  - Closed-beta demonstrating clear AI analytical evolution beyond basic search.
- **Evolution KPIs:** User engagement with AI-generated insights, perceived AI intelligence growth, quality of autonomous pattern detection.

## Phase 3 · Sophisticated Reasoning (Months 10–15)
- **Evolution Goals:** Achieve sophisticated AI reasoning capabilities and deep causal understanding of user patterns and aspirations.
- **Advanced Intelligence:**
  - Conversational reasoning interface demonstrating deep understanding of user context and patterns.
  - Sophisticated hypothesis generation based on nuanced analysis of experiential correlations.
  - Guided causal exploration that reflects genuine AI understanding of user's personal dynamics.
  - Full Aspirational Self integration with intelligent progress tracking and alignment insights.
  - Reward Signal Dashboard providing explicit feedback on growth trajectory alignment.
- **Evolution Milestones:**
  - Conversational AI demonstrating sophisticated reasoning in at least three validated user scenarios.
  - Evidence-based reasoning library demonstrating AI's mature analytical capabilities.
  - Production-ready sophisticated AI partner experience for premium tier.
- **Evolution KPIs:** Quality of AI reasoning conversations, user perception of AI sophistication, successful aspirational alignment guidance.

## Cross-Phase Evolution Enablers
- **Privacy & Trust:** Implement consent management, audit logs, and encryption to enable the deep data access required for AI evolution.
- **Evolution Monitoring:** Build profiling and telemetry tools to track AI's developing intelligence across experiential learning, pattern recognition, and reasoning pipelines.
- **Learning Feedback Loops:** Integrate continuous feedback mechanisms enabling the AI to improve its understanding quality, search intelligence, and conversational sophistication.

## Risk Mitigation Plan
- **Insight Accuracy:** Maintain human-in-the-loop review for initial rollouts; flag low-confidence insights automatically.
- **User Trust:** Provide transparent messaging about data handling and optional cloud escalations.
- **Scalability:** Design ingestion and graph pipelines for parallel execution to accommodate growing data volumes.
