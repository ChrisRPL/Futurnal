# Production-Ready Code Only

- Never introduce mockups, placeholders, or dummy logic.
- Every feature, API, or integration must be fully functional and wired end-to-end.
- Treat stubs as technical debt: replace them with real implementations before shipping.
- Ensure tests execute against real behaviour, not mocked-out functionality.
