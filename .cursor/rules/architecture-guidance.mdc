# Architecture & Requirements Guidance

- Maintain the layered approach defined in [system-architecture.md](mdc:architecture/system-architecture.md): on-device foundation, dynamic PKG, and proactive insight/causal exploration.
- When modifying ingestion, ensure connectors feed Unstructured.io parsing and produce semantic triples as outlined in the architecture document.
- Respect privacy-first principles: default to local processing, request explicit consent for cloud escalations, and keep audit logging intact.
- Update both graph and vector stores in tandem; hybrid search depends on synchronized indices.
- Align code changes with [system-requirements.md](mdc:requirements/system-requirements.md) functional/non-functional requirements and keep roadmap phase alignment in mind per [roadmap.md](mdc:requirements/roadmap.md).
