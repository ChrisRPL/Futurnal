# Documentation Style Rules

- Begin each document with a one-line summary describing its purpose, mirroring existing files.
- Keep documentation ASCII-only unless quoting existing Unicode content.
- Preserve the current section structure (Mission, Competitive Landscape, etc.) to stay aligned with Futurnal's organization strategy.
- When adding new docs, link them from [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](mdc:DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) to maintain the onboarding flow.
- Cross-reference related materials using relative links to leverage Cursor navigation features (e.g., `[system-architecture.md](mdc:architecture/system-architecture.md)`).
