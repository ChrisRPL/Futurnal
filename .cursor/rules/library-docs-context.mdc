description: Require Context7 and Brave research before integrating third-party SDKs or libraries

# Library & SDK Research Rule

- Before adopting or extending any third-party library/SDK, resolve its documentation via the Context7 MCP (`mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` → `mcp_context7_get-library-docs`) to capture the latest API guidance.
- Supplement documentation review with Brave MCP web search (or equivalent `@Web` research) to spot best practices, known issues, and recent changes.
- Summarize key findings in implementation notes or feature docs so future contributors understand the chosen integration strategy.
