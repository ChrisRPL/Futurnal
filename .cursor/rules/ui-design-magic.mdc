# UI Design Inspiration Rule

- When planning or modifying any UI component or surface, call `mcp_21st-devmagic_21st_magic_component_inspiration` to gather design references before writing code.
- If you need implementation-ready snippets, follow up with `mcp_21st-devmagic_21st_magic_component_builder` so the chosen pattern lands in the codebase accurately.
- Note the selected inspirations in feature docs or PR notes to keep the team aligned with Futurnal's aesthetic.
