# Futurnal Project Playbook

## Product Vision & Strategy
- Start with the product context in [docs/product-vision.md](mdc:docs/product-vision.md) and [docs/market-analysis.md](mdc:docs/market-analysis.md) to understand mission, target users, and competitive positioning.
- Reference [docs/key-difference.md](mdc:docs/key-difference.md) when clarifying how Futurnal extends beyond standard GraphRAG and the role of the causal insight layer.
- Long-term strategy, including federated learning and decentralized knowledge commons, lives in [docs/future-vision.md](mdc:docs/future-vision.md).

## Architecture & Requirements
- System design details are captured in [architecture/system-architecture.md](mdc:architecture/system-architecture.md); consult this before modifying ingestion, PKG, or causal workflows.
- Functional and non-functional requirements are defined in [requirements/system-requirements.md](mdc:requirements/system-requirements.md); roadmap milestones and KPIs are tracked in [requirements/roadmap.md](mdc:requirements/roadmap.md).

## Option B Implementation (CRITICAL)
- **Phase 1 Roadmap**: [docs/phase-1/PHASE-1-OPTION-B-ROADMAP.md](mdc:docs/phase-1/PHASE-1-OPTION-B-ROADMAP.md) - 5-month timeline for AI evolution platform
- **Critical Trilogy**: [docs/phase-1/CRITICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_TRILOGY.md](mdc:docs/phase-1/CRITICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_TRILOGY.md) - Training-Free GRPO, TOTAL, AgentFlow
- **Production Plans**: [docs/phase-1/*-production-plan/](mdc:docs/phase-1/) - Module-by-module implementation guides
- **Frontend Design**: [FRONTEND_DESIGN.md](mdc:FRONTEND_DESIGN.md) - Visual design system and branding guidelines

## Development Prompts & Guides
- Implementation prompts for each development phase are in [prompts/phase-1-archivist.md](mdc:prompts/phase-1-archivist.md), [prompts/phase-2-analyst.md](mdc:prompts/phase-2-analyst.md), and [prompts/phase-3-guide.md](mdc:prompts/phase-3-guide.md); use them when planning or executing sprint tasks.
- Use [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](mdc:DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for the recommended document consumption order and cross-links during onboarding.

## Implementation Order
Follow [docs/phase-1/overview.md](mdc:docs/phase-1/overview.md) for correct implementation sequence. Current next: **Entity-Relationship Extraction** → Module 01: Temporal Extraction.
