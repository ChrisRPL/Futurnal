# Futurnal Prompt Usage

- Treat each prompt file as a task checklist for its respective phase: Archivist, Analyst, Guide.
- Ensure prompt updates remain consistent with the phased roadmap in [requirements/roadmap.md](mdc:requirements/roadmap.md).
- Keep prompts action-oriented and ready to paste into development workflows or planning documents.
- When refining prompts, cross-reference system requirements and architecture to avoid drift from the approved design.
