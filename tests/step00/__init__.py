"""Step 00: Foundation & Research Alignment - Infrastructure Verification Tests.

This module contains tests that verify all infrastructure components exist
and function correctly before proceeding with Phase 1 implementation.

The goal is NOT to test full functionality (that's done in component-specific tests),
but to verify the infrastructure is ready for integration.
